      What is this?
    </h1>
    <p>
      A digital business card of sorts.  Also a bit of a chance to work on my
      web dev skills.  Maybe do some blogging.  A place to test stuff.  That sort of thing.

      I purchased this domain several months ago for e-mail purposes.  Figured since I had it I
      might as well host something here.
