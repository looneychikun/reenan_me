# Setting up the Blog

Before actually doing any writing, I had to create the thing.

I'll babble for a bit since I need to fill out the page.

  1. This should be a list, I think?
  2. Second Item
  3. Lists always look best with at least three items.

Ok, lets try `<this>` and \<that>

What happens if I try to add a card here?

<div class="no-prose flex justify-center">
  <div class="card bg-base-100 w-96 shadow-sm">
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1606107557195-0e29a4b5b4aa.webp"
        alt="Shoes" />
    </figure>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h2 class="card-title">Card Title</h2>
      <p>A card component has a figure, a body part, and inside body there are title and actions parts</p>
      <div class="card-actions justify-end">
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Buy Now</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Seems to work.

I'll need to figure out something about the hero div screwing up the idea of centering.

# Creating the content collection

Here I'll actually start explaining the pieces that make up the blog.  Aside
from the page's base layout, which I'll post about later.  The first step
is deciding how we want the "content" to be stored.

Theres a million different ways to do this, but I've decided on using local
markdown files stored directly in the repo.  It's **easy**, _cheap_ (read: **free**), 
and I can use any local markdown editor I want.

Next, we turn our attention to [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
